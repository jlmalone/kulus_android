COPY-PASTE THIS TO YOUR REMOTE AGENT FOR FEATURE PARITY
=====================================================

I need you to achieve feature parity between the Kulus Android app and the iOS Hamumu app.

**Repository**: https://github.com/jlmalone/kulus_android

**Your Mission**:
1. Analyze the iOS Hamumu codebase to catalog ALL features
2. Compare with the current Android implementation
3. Create a comprehensive gap analysis
4. Implement missing features in priority order

**CRITICAL: Read FEATURE_PARITY_PROMPT.md first** - it contains:
- Complete step-by-step process
- Feature discovery methodology
- Implementation examples (ReadingDetailScreen, etc.)
- Code templates for common patterns
- Testing requirements
- Success criteria

**Phase 1: Discovery (Do This First)**
Create these three documents before writing any code:

1. **FEATURE_INVENTORY.md** - Complete list of ALL iOS features
   - Authentication & onboarding
   - Bluetooth integration
   - Glucose data management
   - Synchronization
   - UI/UX features
   - Advanced features (OCR, photos, etc.)
   - Notifications
   - Export capabilities

2. **FEATURE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md** - Feature matrix comparing iOS vs Android
   - What exists in both
   - What's missing in Android
   - What Android does better
   - Priority ratings (High/Medium/Low)
   - Complexity estimates

3. **IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md** - Phased implementation plan
   - Phase 1: Critical missing features (ReadingDetail, Onboarding, Settings)
   - Phase 2: High-value features (Charts, Photo OCR, Profiles)
   - Phase 3: Advanced features (Bluetooth, Export, Notifications)
   - Phase 4: Polish (Animations, Accessibility, Widgets)

**Phase 2: Implementation**
Start with Priority 1 features:
1. Reading Detail Screen (EXAMPLE PROVIDED in prompt)
2. Onboarding Flow
3. Settings Screen
4. Charts & Analytics
5. (Continue based on your roadmap)

**Key Requirements**:
- Follow existing Android architecture (MVVM, Hilt, Room, Compose)
- Use Material3 with Matrix neon theme
- Maintain offline-first approach
- Document each feature as you implement
- Test on real device
- Build frequently: `./gradlew assembleDebug`

**iOS Reference Code Location**:
You'll need access to the iOS codebase to analyze features. The structure is:
```
ios_code/hamumu/HamamuMobile/
├── Services/ (API, Bluetooth, Data services)
├── Models/ (GlucoseData, etc.)
├── Views/ (Dashboard, Onboarding, etc.)
└── ContentView.swift (Main coordinator)
```

**Success = 100% Feature Parity**
Android app must have ALL features from iOS app with equivalent or better UX.

**Start Here**:
1. Read FEATURE_PARITY_PROMPT.md completely
2. Review the iOS codebase
3. Create FEATURE_INVENTORY.md
4. Create FEATURE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md
5. Create IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
6. Submit these for review before coding

Let me know when Phase 1 (Discovery) is complete and ready for review.
