COPY THIS TO YOUR REMOTE CLAUDE CODE AGENTS
==========================================

I need you to build the UI for the Kulus Android glucose monitoring app. The repository is at:

https://github.com/jlmalone/kulus_android

IMPORTANT: Read INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_AGENTS.md first - it contains complete copy-paste ready code for all screens.

Your task:
1. Clone the repository
2. Read INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_AGENTS.md completely
3. Follow Phase 1 step-by-step to create:
   - ReadingsViewModel
   - GlucoseReadingCard component
   - ReadingsListScreen
   - AddReadingViewModel
   - AddReadingScreen
   - Update MainActivity with Navigation

All code is provided in INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_AGENTS.md - just copy, paste, and test.

The app has:
✅ Complete backend integration (Kulus Firebase API)
✅ Room database for offline storage
✅ Beautiful Matrix neon theme
✅ Hilt dependency injection
✅ Repository pattern

You just need to build the screens using Jetpack Compose.

Start by reading these files in order:
1. INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_AGENTS.md (your main guide)
2. CLAUDE.md (additional context)
3. README.md (project overview)

Then create the files listed in Phase 1 of INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_AGENTS.md.

Build and test after each file. Let me know when Phase 1 is complete.
